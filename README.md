Siamese Neural Networks for Facial Recognition
Overview
This project implements a facial recognition system using Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs). Siamese networks are particularly well-suited for one-shot learning tasks, such as facial recognition, where the goal is to distinguish between two inputs based on their similarity. In this case, the network learns to differentiate between facial images by comparing them and outputting a similarity score.

Features
Siamese Neural Network Architecture: Utilizes twin networks with shared weights to process input pairs.
Face Verification: Given two images, the model predicts whether they belong to the same person.
One-shot Learning: Capable of learning new faces with very few examples.
Customizable: Easily adaptable for different image sizes and architectures.
Preprocessing: Includes face detection and alignment as preprocessing steps.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
(Optional) CUDA for GPU support
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-siamese-net.git
cd facial-recognition-siamese-net
Install Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
This project uses the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. You can download it directly or use your custom dataset. The dataset should be organized in pairs, where each pair of images either belongs to the same person or different people.

Training the Model
Prepare the dataset: Ensure that your dataset is correctly formatted and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Configure the model: Modify the model parameters in config.py, including the network architecture, learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --config config.yaml
This script will train the Siamese network on your dataset and save the model weights.

Testing the Model
After training, you can test the model's performance on a separate test set:

bash
Copy code
python test.py --model checkpoint/model.h5 --test_data path/to/test_data
The script will output accuracy metrics and display sample pairs with their predicted similarity scores.

Inference
You can also use the trained model for inference on new image pairs:

bash
Copy code
python infer.py --model checkpoint/model.h5 --image1 path/to/image1.jpg --image2 path/to/image2.jpg
This script will load the model and predict whether the two images belong to the same person.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% on the LFW test set. The accuracy may vary depending on the architecture and dataset used.

Customization
Network Architecture: The current implementation uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base model. You can easily replace it with more complex architectures like ResNet or MobileNet.
Loss Function: By default, contrastive loss is used to train the Siamese network. You can experiment with other loss functions like triplet loss.
Image Preprocessing: The current pipeline includes basic preprocessing steps. You can add more advanced preprocessing like histogram equalization, data augmentation, etc.
